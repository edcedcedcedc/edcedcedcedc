## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
I'm a software engineer, currently in my second year of the [OSSU](https://github.com/edcedcedcedc/computer-science-curriculum-ossu) self-paced computer science curriculum. Iâ€™m passionate about competitive programming and software development. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and working on projects that help me grow my skills.

- ðŸ”­ Right now, Iâ€™m working on a C++ and SFML cube project, and preparing for the next Codeforces contest!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning linear algebra, math for CS, calculus (Calc 1B), and the "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" course.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborating on software engineering and open-source projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about functional programming!
