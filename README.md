## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

I am a software engineer, currently in my third year at Open Source Society University pursuing Open Education in Computer Science, and a Google Summer of Code 2025 alumnus. I enjoy competitive programming, client-server programming, functional programming, object-oriented programming, event-driven programming, and mathematics. I have a partial interest in game development and a strong foundation in Linux systems, which I use almost daily. I work with Python every other day and have professional experience with JavaScript/TypeScript. I have also completed academic projects in Java, C++, and a bit of Bash. I learn significantly by reading and analyzing othersâ€™ code, always striving to improve by imitating and adapting different approaches. I also contribute to open-source projects and open PRs, actively collaborating with developers to improve software, fix issues, and enhance functionality.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m studying three courses concurrently:  
â€¢ Introduction to Probability <br>
â€¢ Computer Systems A Programmer's Perspective <br>
â€¢ Foundations of Computer Security

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborating on open-source projects.  
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about math, computer science, functional or object-oriented programming, and client-server systems.  
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him  
âš¡ Fun facts: I love cats, lifting weights, video games, coffee, chocolate, and surrounding myself with positive, driven people!

  This is my favourite cat picture on the internet!<br>
