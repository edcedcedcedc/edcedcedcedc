## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a software engineer, with 3 years of experience in total, which includes academic projects, personal initiatives, competitive programming, and 1.5 years of professional experience in frontend developement. At the moment I am in my second year of the [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/edcedcedcedc/computer-science-curriculum-ossu) self-paced computer science curriculum. Iâ€™m passionate about competitive programming and software development in general. I enjoy about solving problems, especially those from semi-unfamiliar domains. Tackling such problems not only sharpens my problem-solving skills but also broadens my perspective and strengthens my ability to adapt and learn quickly.

- ðŸ”­ Right now Iâ€™m working on a C++ and SFML cube project, and preparing for the next Codeforces contest!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning four courses concurrently, Linear Algebra, Math For CS, Calculus 1b, and the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborating on software engineering and open-source projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about functional programming!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/androranogajec/) or [email](mailto:ranogaet@gmail.com).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun facts: I love cats, video games, coffee, chocolate, and being around positive and motivated people!
