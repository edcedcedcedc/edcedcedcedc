## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

I am a software engineer, currently in my third year at [Open Source Society University](https://cs.ossu.dev/) pursuing Open Education in Computer Science, and a Google Summer of Code 2025 alumnus. I enjoy competitive programming, client-server programming, functional programming, object-oriented programming, event-driven programming, and mathematics. I have a partial interest in game development and a strong foundation in Linux systems, which I use almost daily. I work with Python every other day and have professional experience with JavaScript/TypeScript. I have also completed academic projects in Java, C++, and a bit of Bash. I learn significantly by reading and analyzing othersâ€™ code, always striving to improve by imitating and adapting different approaches. I also contribute to open-source projects and open PRs, actively collaborating with developers to improve software, fix issues, and enhance functionality.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning three courses concurrently, Introduction to Probability, Computer Systems A Programmer's Perspective and Foundations of Computer Security.<br>
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a part time volunteer software engineer for [Ruqola](https://github.com/KDE/ruqola) where I help finishing E2EE using C++/QT6/KF6.<br>
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborating on open-source projects.<br>
ðŸš€ Iâ€™m a [Google Summer of Code 2025](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/RTuXxB1k) alumnus!<br> 
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about math, computer science, functional or object-oriented programming, and client-server systems.<br>
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him.<br>
âš¡ Fun facts: I love cats, since recently dogs, lifting weights, video games, coffee, chocolate, and surrounding myself with positive, driven people!

  This is probably my favourite cat picture on the internet!<br>
