### Hi there 👋  

I’m a software engineer and a general-purpose programmer with experience in web and game development. I’m stack-agnostic, highly flexible, and currently in my third year at the [Open Source Society University](https://cs.ossu.dev/), pursuing Open Education in Computer Science, and a [Google Summer of Code 2025](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/RTuXxB1k) alumnus, where I helped build an end-to-end encryption system.



- 🌱 Currently learning Probability for Computer Scientists, Introduction to Computer Systems, and Foundations of Computer Security, while deepening my focus on game development and Unreal Engine 
- 🔭 Part-time volunteer software engineer for [Ruqola](https://github.com/KDE/ruqola), working on E2EE (C++/Qt6/KF6)  
- 💬 Ask me about game development, computer science, math,  or debugging - the Rocket.Chat team once dubbed me a *“professional bug researcher”* 😄 

This is probably my favourite cat picture on the internet!
